# Oracle 12c Interactive Poster - Logic Sample

### Overview

This repository contains the core JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS for the Oracle Database 12c Interactive Poster.

### Technical Context

Developed in 2012-2013, this project demonstrates high-density data visualization and complex state management using **Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery**.

### Architectural Decisions

At the time of development, early frameworks (like AngularJS) were evaluated but bypassed in favor of a custom-built, lightweight architecture. This decision was made to ensure:

- Precise DOM control for hundreds of interactive elements
- Maximum performance and low memory footprint in the browser
- Seamless state transitions without framework-induced latency
